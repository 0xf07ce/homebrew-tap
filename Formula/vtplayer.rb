  # ffmpeg is required at both build (libav headers + pkg-config) and runtime
  # (linked shared libraries). vtplayer delegates *all* audio decoding —
  # local files and internet-radio streams — to libavformat/libavcodec/
  # libswresample, so the formerly optional runtime `ffmpeg` binary
  # dependency has been replaced with a mandatory library-level link.

  # Previously git-cloned by CMake FetchContent and built from source on every
  # bottle. Now taken from prebuilt Homebrew bottles via
  # -DVTPLAYER_USE_SYSTEM_DEPS=ON (find_package). This removes the TagLib
  # source build and per-dependency resource sha256 churn. cxxopts is no
  # longer listed: it is vendored as a single header in deps/include/cxxopts/.

  # staged as a resource and fed to CMake via FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_VENTTY
  # (no network during the build). This resource's sha256 is bumped
  # automatically by the release workflow's `prepare` job.
