  # ffmpeg is required at both build (libav headers + pkg-config) and runtime
  # (linked shared libraries). vtplayer delegates *all* audio decoding —
  # local files and internet-radio streams — to libavformat/libavcodec/
  # libswresample, so the formerly optional runtime `ffmpeg` binary
  # dependency has been replaced with a mandatory library-level link.

  # ventty has no upstream install()/export() rules, so it cannot be a
  # find_package dependency. It is small and tagged infrequently, so it stays
  # staged as a resource and fed to CMake via FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_VENTTY
  # (no network during the build). This resource's sha256 is bumped
  # automatically by the release workflow's `prepare` job.
